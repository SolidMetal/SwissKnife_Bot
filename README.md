**WHAT CAN THIS BOT DO?**
-------------------------
A small yet helpful telegram bot. Features: weather forecast, RNG, image processing and coin flip.  
To start using the bot press "START" button (if you are a new user) or just type /start (works at any time).
Navigation through menus and sub-menus is performed with the help of screen menu buttons, that appear during operation.

WEATHER FORECAST
--------------
Bot will send you a brief weather forecast after you enter the city name. 
Inside the forecast there will be some information about the weather at the call time and also temperature info for the next two days.
An image showing current weather is also added. Note that the cities on the image don't match with the city or town you look for.  


RANDOM NUMBER GENERATOR
-------------------------  
The bot will ask you to enter a positive number (X) and then it will return you a random number between zero and X. 

IMAGE PROCESSING
---------------------
You send an image to the bot and it is sent back with some kind of filter or effect.
At the present moment there are three modes:
* making a negative copy of an image
* Image to PDF convertation
* Image to black-and-white PDF  

COIN FLIP
-------------- 
Thats a simple one. Bot imitates a flip of the coin afrer you press the button and tells you if it is Heads or Tails.
